# Interfacing UltraSonic Sensor using AVR Microcontroller
## Introduction
The ultrasonic sensor emits a high-frequency sound pulse and calculates the distance depending upon the time taken by the echo signal to travel back after reflecting from the desired target. The speed of sound is 341 meters per second in air. After the distance is calculated, it will be displayed on the LCD display

## Ultrasonic Sensor

Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system.HC-SR-04 module has an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver, and control circuit on a single board.The module has only 4 pins, Vcc, Gnd, Trig, and Echo.

## AVR Microcontroller(ATMEGA328)

ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory.

ATmega328 has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM). This property shows if the electric supply supplied to the micro-controller is removed, even then it can store the data and can provide results after providing it with the electric supply. Moreover, ATmega-328 has 2KB Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). Other characteristics will be explained later. ATmega 328 has several different features which make it the most popular device in todayâ€™s market. These features consist of advanced RISC architecture, good performance, low power consumption, real timer counter having separate oscillator, 6 PWM pins, programmable Serial USART, programming lock for software security, throughput up to 20 MIPS etc. Further details about ATmega 328 will be given later in this section.

## LCD Display

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
