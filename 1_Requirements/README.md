# Interfacing UltraSonic Sensor using AVR Microcontroller
## Introduction
The ultrasonic sensor emits a high-frequency sound pulse and calculates the distance depending upon the time taken by the echo signal to travel back after reflecting from the desired target. The speed of sound is 341 meters per second in air. After the distance is calculated, it will be displayed on the LCD display

## Ultrasonic Sensor

Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system.HC-SR-04 module has an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver, and control circuit on a single board.The module has only 4 pins, Vcc, Gnd, Trig, and Echo.

## AVR Microcontroller(ATMEGA328)

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

## LCD Display

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
