# ABSTRACT

In this project, an integrated system using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 based on AT Mega328P microcontroller was done. It is used to control the processing of data and to display the output. The microcontroller is connected to ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 which contains the piezoelectric with a particular frequency. This will generate ultrasonic waves and the waves will be reflected by the object whose distance to be measured. The time difference between the transmitted wave and reflected wave will be measured by the sensors. The accurate distance between the object and the sensors will be detected. Simulation output displayed in SIMULIDE.

Distance measurement of an object in the path of a person, equipment, or a vehicle, stationary or moving is used in a large number of applications such as robotic movement control, vehicle control, blind man’s walking stick, medical applications, etc.

Nowadays, we have some difficulties in obtaining
the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring
tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation
of manual error. Before this, engineers have produced a range
finder module but in the end, they find out the module have
many disadvantages like limitation for distance, different result
for different coloured obstacles, and need a calibration for every
time before starts using it. Manual distance measuring is always
done at the expense of human error. Precise and fix
measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this
project. 

This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to
4m with the accuracy of1cm.This project is used to measure the
distance by using ultrasonic sensors. It works by transmitting
ultrasonic waves at 40 kHz. Then, the transducers will measure
the amount of time taken for a pulse of sound travel to a
particular surfaces and return as the reflected echo. After that,
the circuit that have been programmed with AT mega
microcontroller will calculate the distance based on the speed of
sound at 25°C which an ambient temperature and also the time
taken. The distance then will be display on a LCD module. The
importance of the project is calculating accurate distance from
any obstacle that we want to measure. The device can be used in
many different fields and categories like distance calculation in
construction field, robots, car sensor to avoid obstacles and
many other applications. The building process of the device was
based on using as much as possible from the courses taken in the
university, like Micro Processor, Basic Electrical Engineering,
Multimedia and systems and Electronics Devices and also
practical work in the laboratories.
