# ABSTRACT

In this project, an integrated system using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 based on AT Mega328P microcontroller was done. It is used to control the processing of data and to display the output. The microcontroller is connected to ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 which contains the piezoelectric with a particular frequency. This will generate ultrasonic waves and the waves will be reflected by the object whose distance to be measured. The time difference between the transmitted wave and reflected wave will be measured by the sensors. The accurate distance between the object and the sensors will be detected. Simulation output displayed in SIMULIDE.

Distance measurement of an object in the path of a person, equipment, or a vehicle, stationary or moving is used in a large number of applications such as robotic movement control, vehicle control, blind manâ€™s walking stick, medical applications, etc.
